  <h2>Statement</h2>
  <p>Hi! I’m Mikee Jem S. Contreras, a 19-year-old Year 13 student who moved to New Zealand from the Philippines just this January. Before coming here, I was studying HR Management at Batangas State University as a 2nd-year student. It’s definitely been an adjustment moving to a new country, but I’m really excited about the fresh start and all the new things I’m going to experience.
One of my biggest passions is exploring new places—whether it’s discovering local spots or traveling to far-off places. I’m always up for an adventure, and food is a big part of it! I love trying different kinds of food and am always on the lookout for something new to taste. It’s one of the best ways to learn about other cultures, and it’s just fun.
<p>When I’m not exploring or eating, I enjoy listening to music, playing both board and online games, and learning new things. I find it easy to get lost in a good game or a new playlist. I’m also really into experimenting with recipes in the kitchen, trying to make something delicious out of random ingredients.</p>
<p>I love being around people, but I’m happiest when I’m with that special person who can make me smile and laugh like a kid. It’s the little moments like those that make everything feel worth it.</p>
<p>Since moving here, I’ve been adjusting to the differences in culture and life. It’s been exciting, but there are definitely challenges along the way. Despite that, I’m super excited about the future, making new friends, learning more about myself, and growing in this new environment.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to making the most out of my time here in New Zealand and can’t wait to see where this adventure takes me!
